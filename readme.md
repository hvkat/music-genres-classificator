#PyTorch Classifier
Simple classifier based on neural network consisting of fully connected layers.
Project build in order to grow own skills, for personal, no commercial use. 

Project operates on audio features.

#Dataset
Dataset used is
[GTZAN Dataset - Music Genre Classification](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html). The collection consists of samples of 10 music genres, 100 samples each. 


#Preprocessing
Data was preprocessed with use of [librosa](https://librosa.org/), a tool for audio and music processing and analysis in Python (*version librosa 0.9.0, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5996429*).
Specific audio features were retrieved.
